          How can we honour our heroes and highlight a few of our cultureâ€™s
          musical triumphs, while also keeping a vigilant eye on our problems
          that continue to morph and fester? We can create a concert unlike any
          other we have ever played. In this program of imaginative leaps and
          unexpected connections, Kronos celebrates the 1960s, a time of radical
          social turmoil and free-wheeling energy in America that led to the
          formation of Kronos in 1973, and also incorporates elements of the
          quartet's response to Trump's Muslim Ban of 2017.
